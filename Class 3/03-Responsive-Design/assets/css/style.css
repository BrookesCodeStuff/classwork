/* 
What is the flex property a shorthand property for?
What is it doing here? 
It is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
Here it's stating that the flex-grow and shrink properties are set to 0, which means that the item
will not grow or shrink to fit the container. Flex-basis sets the container's initial size of the 
flex item, before any available space is distributed to the flex items.

What is it doing here?

and the rest of the items stacking below it in order.
